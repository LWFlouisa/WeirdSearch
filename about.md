Welcome to the WeirdSearch engine.

I decided to create this archive as a responce to the fact that most Youtube unfiction is expected to use one creature either from SCP Vault ( a brilliant piece of work ), or Creepypasta. I needed specifically for a subset of immersive narrative that are influenced by visual novels, and have their own lore and mythos.

Here you will find periodic updates. Some of these pages will be indexed on Yacy.
