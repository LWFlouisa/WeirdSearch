title: "Abstract Monsters"

Abstract monsters dont have a concrete physical or spiritual form, and more resemble a disturbing or depressing atmosphere or mood.

In my approach the monster is not a specific creature or murder, but the way humans treat other they politically or socially disagree with.

In such cases the monster in a physical symbol of said idealogy or philosophy.
