Interactive Webcomics, or IWC, are electronic graphic novels distributed as visual novels, but with a major difference: IWC tends to split scenes into panels on the same background image.

This generally includes captions and word balloons that reveal themselves on the same page over time, and otherwise structures their choices in NVL mode in renpy.
