A limited apocalypse is a small scale disaster that only effects a specific continent. Generally weapons or environmental effects do not cause the same kind of chaos as Nuclear Winter.

Artificial Intelligence, and disasters caused by this, is also treated in a similar manner, with most of the damage confined to Academic or Corporate institutions on a specific continent.

It can be thought of as a nerfed apocalypse. AI rebellions are small in impact.
