Multimedia Novels are novel length narratives in the immersive narrative mode, but with the only gameplay elements switching between reading blog posts, podcasts, art galleries, and videos. In general, these tends to be contained on a single website on github pages or an actual domain, rather than on ticktock, youtube, or twitter.

Sometimes videos can be mirrored on other websites, and generally have their own lore rather than be creepypasta fanfiction.

Stories tend to be in the gothic romance mode with cross over with eroguro. Also tend to be set in same world as advertised work.
